          <h3 class="header-tittle">Who is this service for?</h3>
          <p class="about-text _3">We have created this service for business owners in the medical/dental industry who aren´t tech savvy and don´t want to spend their time on building and maintaining a website. All of todays solutions on the market is either expensive because you have to hire someone on a hourly cost to fix stuff and update your website, or it could be very time consuming because you yourself always have to spend time on first learning how to operate a website and then to keep it updated and good looking for your customers.
            <br>
            <br>So it´s basically a service for you that don´t want to be sitting by the computer and do designing/updating, you just want to explain how you want your website to look like and then have somebody else to take care of it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="w-clearfix div-paginator">
          <h3 class="header-tittle">Why not use a CMS service?</h3>
          <p class="about-text _3">A common thing for a agency is that after they made a website for you they leave you with learning a CMS service where you can do small changes to your website yourself. This is a solution that works for small changes but if you want to change something a bit more complex than a picture or some text then it can become difficult. When you think about it, how much time do you spend when you are changing these CMS settings, when you have to learn how everything works??? In our experience clients usually spend a lot of their time doing changes to make it look good and in the end most of them call up the agency and ask for help.
            <br>"Stop wasting your time on technical stuff and start spending time on how you can grow your business instead!"</p>

          <h3 class="header-tittle _2">HOW´S THE WEBSITE CREATION PROCESS?</h3>
          <p class="about-text _3 _2">Our web developers will create a website from your preference.
            <br>The first thing you will do when you sign up is to fill in a form. This form will go through design aspects as well as business information. This will give us a good overview of what you want your site to look like and what information you would like to feature. We will then create a first prototype site from this information that we collected. Take your feedback and then get some complementing information such as: text, pictures, contact info etc. This process takes about 1-2 weeks (depending on how big of a project) and after that you will be ready to launch your new website.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="div-paginator">
          <h3 class="header-tittle _2">WHAT HAPPENS IF IM NOT HAPPY WITH THE DESIGN?</h3>
          <p class="about-text _3 _2">If you are not happy with the design we would gladly take your feedback and improve it to your specific requirements. If you think that we are way to far of and your not happy at all with the prototype design that we provided, you can have a full refund, no questions asked. If you have very specific design or functional request&nbsp;<a class="text-link" href="contact.html">contact</a>&nbsp;us and try to be as specific as possible.</p>

          <h3 class="header-tittle">HOW DOES IT WORK IF I WANT TO UPDATE MY WEBSITE?</h3>
          <p class="about-text _3">We have made it as simple as possible for you to update your website, all you need to do is to send our support an email with a description of the job that you want to be done on your website. You can update your site with small jobs an&nbsp;unlimited&nbsp;amount of times. &nbsp;But we only allow one update at a time. We are also fair and we have found out that our monthly clients are as well. We will let you know if you’re stretching the friendship by using the service in an unnecessary way.</p>

          <h3 class="header-tittle">HOW LONG DOES AN UPDATE TAKE?</h3>
          <p class="about-text _3">We usually complete tasks on the same business day, most within 8 hours (Unless its a bigger update). If you request a task over the weekend, we generally take care of it on Monday morning unless we deem it to be urgent..</p>
